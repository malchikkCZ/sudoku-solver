# Sudoku Solver

### Created by MalchikkCZ

Do you have the *SUDOKU puzzle* you are unable to crack? Or do you want to solve some *SUDOKU puzzle* by yourself, but you don't know how to get one? This simple app will help you!

### **There are two modes in this app.**

After you run this app, the computer will ask you which mode you want to choose:

> `Do you want to (S)olve some SUDOKU or to (G)enerate a new one?`

You are going to make your choice by simply input *S* or *G*.

---

First mode is to **SOLVE** a *SUDOKU puzzle* you provide it line by line. You should give it a sequence of numbers for each line going from top to bottom filled with number 0 where there is a blank cell.

> `Enter the numbers in 1. row >>> 150209004`\
`Enter the numbers in 2. row >>> 040006`\
etc.

After you enter all the numbers in all rows, you may start the app to dive deep into algorithm to solve this. Be careful though, if you enter something wrong, you will have to start again.

---

The second mode is to actualy **GENERATE** a new *SUDOKU puzzle* from scratch. You can then copy and paste it to some text editor and solve by yourself *(or even provide it to first mode of this app, but why?)*

This generator is using naive method of generating the puzzle, so there is no way to predict the difficulty of the puzzle (yet).

### **What else is missing?**

It's necessary to say that I am still working on this app. Here is a *TODO list* of things that should come in later versions:

> - Save generated sudoku into printable file.
> - Simplify script to "load" puzzle to be solved.
> - Generate multiple puzzles into one file.
> - Send generated files via email.
> - Create GUI for the app.
> - Make randomly generated puzzle actually solvable in GUI.

Feel free to fork your copy of this app and improve it to your own needs. If you have some comments of what I should make better, please send me a message or:
